      --scan-classpath, --scan-class-path[=PATH]
                             Scan all directories on the classpath or explicit
                               classpath roots. Without arguments, only
                               directories on the system classpath as well as
                               additional classpath entries supplied via -cp

FILTERS

  -e, --include-engine=ID    Provide the ID of an engine to be included in the
                               test run. This option can be repeated.
  -E, --exclude-engine=ID    Provide the ID of an engine to be excluded from
                               the test run. This option can be repeated.
      --exclude-package=PKG  Provide a package to be excluded from the test
                               run. This option can be repeated.
      --include-package=PKG  Provide a package to be included in the test run.
                               This option can be repeated.
  -n, --include-classname=PATTERN
                             Provide a regular expression to include only
                               classes whose fully qualified names match. To
                               avoid loading classes unnecessarily, the default
                               pattern only includes class names that begin
                               with "Test" or end with "Test" or "Tests". When
                               this option is repeated, all patterns will be
                               combined using OR semantics. Default: ^(Test.*|.+
                               [.$]Test.*|.*Tests?)$
  -N, --exclude-classname=PATTERN
                             Provide a regular expression to exclude those
                               classes whose fully qualified names match. When
                               this option is repeated, all patterns will be
                               combined using OR semantics.
  -t, --include-tag=TAG      Provide a tag or tag expression to include only
                               tests whose tags match. When this option is
                               repeated, all patterns will be combined using OR
                               semantics.
  -T, --exclude-tag=TAG      Provide a tag or tag expression to exclude those
                               tests whose tags match. When this option is
                               repeated, all patterns will be combined using OR
                               semantics.

RUNTIME CONFIGURATION

      --config=KEY=VALUE     Set a configuration parameter for test discovery
                               and execution. This option can be repeated.
      -cp, --classpath, --class-path=PATH
                             Provide additional classpath entries -- for
                               example, for adding engines and their
                               dependencies. This option can be repeated.

CONSOLE OUTPUT

      --color-palette=FILE   Specify a path to a properties file to customize
                               ANSI style of output (not supported by all
                               terminals).
      --details=MODE         Select an output details mode for when tests are
                               executed. Use one of: none, summary, flat, tree,
                               verbose, testfeed. If 'none' is selected, then
                               only the summary and test failures are shown.
                               Default: tree.
      --details-theme=THEME  Select an output details tree theme for when tests
                               are executed. Use one of: ascii, unicode.
                               Default is detected based on default character
                               encoding.
      --single-color         Style test output using only text attributes, no
                               color (not supported by all terminals).

REPORTING

      --fail-if-no-tests     Fail and return exit status code 2 if no tests are
                               found.
      --reports-dir=DIR      Enable report output into a specified local
                               directory (will be created if it does not exist).

WARNING: Delegated to the 'execute' command.
         This behaviour has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
         Please use the 'execute' command directly.
